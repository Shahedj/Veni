# Web Development Project 4 - Veni Vici

Submitted by: Shahad Jaber

This web app: The web app will display one element at a time with information through API calls in a random fashion. The user can influence what they want to see next via a ban list.

Time spent: 6 hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] **Clicking a button creates a new API fetch request and displays at least three attributes from the returned JSON data**
- [X] **Only one item/API call is viewable at a time**
- [X] **API calls appear random to the user**
- [X] **At least one image is displayed per API call**
- [X] **Clicking on a displayed value for one attribute adds it to a displayed ban list**
- [X] **Attributes on the ban list prevent further images/API results with that attribute from being displayed**



* [ ] List anything else that you added to improve the site's functionality! What I can improve is by having a different style for the things that are being added into the ban list.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app. I had a very challenging time to make it work to figure out how to do the API stuff such as fetching info.
